Write a JS function that iterates (counts through) the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 4 print the word "Four" instead of the number and for the multiples of 10 print "Ten". For numbers which are multiples of both four and ten print "TenFour!".

Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, The second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc. For example:

centuryFromYear(1705)  returns (18)
centuryFromYear(1900)  returns (19)
centuryFromYear(1601)  returns (17)
centuryFromYear(2000)  returns (20) 
You are given two angles (in degrees) of a triangle. Write a function to return the 3rd. Note: only positive integers will be tested.
